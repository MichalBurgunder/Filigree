# Filigree

## About
At the end of a three month bootcamp into fullstack-development, we developed a final app to showcase the things that we have learned, which is what you are seeing here. You can either pull the data fro the repo and start the application locally, or you can simply take a look at the final product [here](http://filigree.propulsion-learn.ch). The development of this app took three weeks, including deployment. 

## Description

The idea I had behind this app was to combine my interests in literature and writing with quantitative measurements and mathematics. For this project, I have created a small web-based application where you can test any given text, or author for readability, as well as perform a word and unique word count. Because we fairly little time to realize our ideas, from start to very finish, there is still much to be done before this application can be of any practical use. Further readability tests, stemming, spell checks etc. will hopefully make this tool useful for educators, looking to judge a primary students writing without having to read through their work. As this requires much expertise to understand what the types of mistakes can be made by the student and how to handle them in python as well as designing the tool in the first place, the analyser must be accepted as a small project as opposed to viable, maintainable and scalable software.

## Technical details

I have used Django/Django REST framework for the backend and React for the frontend, as these were the two technologies we have concerneed ourselves with during the bootcamp. Python has been tested for the PEP8 standard using flake8, although no standardised styles have been used for the frontend. I have however, cleaned it of unnecessary imports and commented out code. **Any questionable imports or code I have left as is**, in fear of breaking something that works. Beginners characteristic I suppose. 

Finally, no documentation has been written due to time constraints and a single-person development team.
